# AIClassFacialProject
AI Class Project

The purpose of this project is to map out and define individual facial features of the human face. It is building off the work created by https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition italojs, and expanding on it.
After we use his program to landmark a face, we take measurements based on the placing of those landmarks and then plot them, before running k-means clustering to give us distinct categories of each facial feature of a range of sizes or distances.
